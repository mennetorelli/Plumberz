# Intro
This project extends the research conducted by Luca Lodi and Philippe Scorsolini for the course of "Principles of Programming Languages" at Politecnico di Milano by prof. Matteo Pradella and with the supervision of Riccardo Tommasini. For more information, visit [their repository on GitHub](https://github.com/plumberz/plumberz.github.io)

While the previous research was focused on examining [Pipes](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes) and [Tubes](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tubes) libraries for stream processing in Haskell, this research focuses on the [Conduit](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit) library.
